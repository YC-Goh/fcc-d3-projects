# Tree Map Project

## Requirements

1. User Story #1: My tree map should have a title with a corresponding `id="title"`.

2. User Story #2: My tree map should have a description with a corresponding `id="description"`.

3. User Story #3: My tree map should have `rect` elements with a corresponding `class="tile"` that represent the data.

4. User Story #4: There should be at least 2 different fill colors used for the tiles.

5. User Story #5: Each tile should have the properties `data-name`, `data-category`, and `data-value` containing their corresponding `name`, `category`, and `value`.

6. User Story #6: The area of each tile should correspond to the `data-value` amount: tiles with a larger `data-value` should have a bigger area.

7. User Story #7: My tree map should have a legend with corresponding `id="legend"`.

8. User Story #8: My legend should have `rect` elements with a corresponding `class="legend-item"`.

9. User Story #9: The `rect` elements in the legend should use at least 2 different fill colors.

10. User Story #10: I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.

11. User Story #11: My tooltip should have a `data-value` property that corresponds to the `data-value` of the active area.
