# Scatter Plot Project

## Requirements

1. User Story #1: I can see a `title` element that has a corresponding `id="title"`.

2. User Story #2: I can see an x-axis that has a corresponding `id="x-axis"`.

3. User Story #3: I can see a y-axis that has a corresponding `id="y-axis"`.

4. User Story #4: I can see dots, that each have a class of `dot`, which represent the data being plotted.

5. User Story #5: Each dot should have the properties `data-xvalue` and `data-yvalue` containing their corresponding `x` and `y` values.

6. User Story #6: The `data-xvalue` and `data-yvalue` of each dot should be within the range of the actual data and in the correct data format. For `data-xvalue`, integers (full years) or `Date` objects are acceptable for test evaluation. For `data-yvalue` (minutes), use `Date` objects.

7. User Story #7: The `data-xvalue` and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the x-axis.

8. User Story #8: The `data-yvalue` and its corresponding dot should align with the corresponding point/value on the y-axis.

9. User Story #9: I can see multiple tick labels on the y-axis with `%M:%S` time format.

10. User Story #10: I can see multiple tick labels on the x-axis that show the year.

11. User Story #11: I can see that the range of the x-axis labels are within the range of the actual x-axis data.

12. User Story #12: I can see that the range of the y-axis labels are within the range of the actual y-axis data.

13. User Story #13: I can see a legend containing descriptive text that has `id="legend"`.

14. User Story #14: I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.

15. User Story #15: My tooltip should have a `data-year` property that corresponds to the `data-xvalue` of the active area.
