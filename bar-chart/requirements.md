# Bar Chart Project

## Requirements

1. User Story #1: My chart should have a title with a corresponding `id="title"`.

2. User Story #2: My chart should have a `g` element x-axis with a corresponding `id="x-axis"`.

3. User Story #3: My chart should have a `g` element y-axis with a corresponding `id="y-axis"`.

4. User Story #4: Both axes should contain multiple tick labels, each with a corresponding `class="tick"`.

5. User Story #5: My chart should have a `rect` element for each data point with a corresponding `class="bar"` displaying the data.

6. User Story #6: Each bar should have the properties `data-date` and `data-gdp` containing `date` and `GDP` values.

7. User Story #7: The bar elements' `data-date` properties should match the order of the provided data.

8. User Story #8: The bar elements' `data-gdp` properties should match the order of the provided data.

9. User Story #9: Each bar element's height should accurately represent the data's corresponding `GDP`.

10. User Story #10: The `data-date` attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the x-axis.

11. User Story #11: The `data-gdp` attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the y-axis.

12. User Story #12: I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.

13. User Story #13: My tooltip should have a `data-date` property that corresponds to the `data-date` of the active area.
